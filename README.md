V7: Embedded JavaScript engine 
==============================

Note: This project is in the design phase.

V7 is a C/C++ library that implements Javascript engine. It is designed
to be embedded into other programs to allow scripting and configuration.

## Features
- V7 has small footprint, under 100 kilobytes of compiled x86 code
- V7 provides simple and easy to understand API, and therefore easily extendable
- V7 provides standard library with file IO and sockets interface

To retain it's small size, V7 does not implement full Javascript specification.

## Example: using V7 to load complex configuration in JSON format

## Example: using V7 to provide scripting ability for the online game
